The CSS property `calc()` is not working as expected when used with percentages and other units. For example, the following code snippet doesn't calculate the width correctly:

```css
#myElement {
  width: calc(50% - 10px);
}
```

The expected behavior is that the element's width should be 50% of its container's width minus 10 pixels. However, in some cases, the calculation may not be performed correctly, resulting in an unexpected width.
